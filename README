This repo contains implementation of PHP editor features (i.e. syntax highlighting,
content assist, code validation) for Orion - my Google Summer of Code 2011 project.
You can find both Orion plugins and server-side code here.


Directories info:

* orion-client-php-syntax-highlight-plugin - Orion plugin for syntax highlighting,
  totally client-side
* orion-client-php-content-assist-plugin - Orion plugin for content assist,
  communicates with server-side plugin
* orion-client-php-code-validation-plugin - Orion plugin for code validation,
  communicates with server-side plugin
* orion-server-php-plugin - server-side plugin (bundle) providing required
  functionality for client-side plugins


INSTALLING (applies to Orion M8)

To install PHP syntax highlighting in your own Orion server:
1. Put contents of orion-client-php-syntax-highlight-plugin/web/ into public
   accessible dir
2. Symlink / move orion-client-php-syntax-highlight-plugin/web/css/default-theme.css
   in place of same file in org.eclipse.orion.client.core bundle in your Orion
   server installation
3. Symlink / move orion-client-php-syntax-highlight-plugin/plugins/phpEditingPlugin.html
   into plugins/ folder in org.eclipse.orion.client.core bundle
4. Symlink / move orion-client-php-syntax-highlight-plugin/orion/editor/phpGrammar.js
   into orion/editor/ folder in org.eclipse.orion.client.editor bundle
5. Edit web/defaults.pref file in org.eclipse.orion.client.core bundle in your Orion
   server installation. Add line "/plugins/phpEditingPlugin.html":true
6. Install phpEditingPlugin plugin in Orion using public accessible HTML link to
   orion-client-php-syntax-highlight-plugin/web/plugins/phpEditingPlugin.html
7. Orion will now open PHP files with syntax highlighting

The plugin will be installed in permament manner, i.e. it won't be removed if you
clear your storage (localStorage.clear()).

Note that the plugin cannot be yet installed on any server just by providing the
plugin URL, because some files need to be replaced on server until Orion will
support particular features. Currently these are:
- /web/css/default-theme.css (Orion doesn't provide a way to add custom styles yet)
